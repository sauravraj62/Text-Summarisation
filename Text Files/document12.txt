In 2005, Congress passed the Public Readiness & Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act). Congress took away liability for experimental drugs and vaccines that are released for public use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) whenever a national public health emergency is declared by the Secretaries of the Department of Human Health & Services or Homeland Security in the federal government.  A federal compensation program was discussed in the PREP Act but, as of 2009, there has been no funding of a compensation program for children or adults injured or killed by vaccines or drugs used under an EUA. A report for Congress by the Congressional Research Service   discussed legal issues involved in the 2009 H1N1 outbreak and the declaration of a national public health emergency.PUBLIC HEALTH LAWSBEING PREPARED & TAKING ACTIONH1N1 VACCINE PRODUCT INSERTSNVIC INFORMATION & STATEMENTSSELECTED MEDIA PRINT ARTICLESReuters News Service. July 30, 2009.
