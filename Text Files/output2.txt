H1N1 Flu Virus (Swine Flu): Symptoms, Causes, Tests, and TreatmentsH1N1 flu is also known as swine flu. It's called swine flu because in the past, the people who caught it had direct contact with pigs. That changed several years ago, when a new virus emerged that spread among people who hadn't been near pigs.In 2009, H1N1 was spreading fast around the world, so the World Health Organization called it a pandemic. Since then, people have continued to get sick from swine flu, but not as many.While swine flu isn't as scary as it seemed a few years ago, it's still important to protect yourself from getting it. Like seasonal flu, it can cause more serious health problems for some people. The best bet is to get a flu vaccine, or flu shot, every year. Swine flu is one of the viruses included in the vaccine.The same way as the seasonal flu. When people who have it cough or sneeze, they spray tiny drops of the virus into the air. If you come in contact with these drops, touch a surface (like a doorknob or sink) where the drops landed, or touch something an infected person has recently touched, you can catch H1N1 swine flu.People who have it can spread it one day before they have any symptoms and as many as 7 days after they get sick. Kids can be contagious for as long as 10 days.Despite the name, you can't catch swine flu from eating bacon, ham, or any other pork product.These, too, are pretty much the same as seasonal flu. They can include:Like the regular flu, swine flu can lead to more serious problems including pneumonia, a lung infection, and other breathing problems. And it can make an illness like diabetes or asthma worse. If you have symptoms like shortness of breath, severe vomiting, pain in your belly or sides, dizziness, or confusion, call your doctor or 911 right away.Yes. Without one it's hard to tell whether you have swine flu or seasonal flu, because most symptoms are the same. If you have swine flu, you may be more likely to feel sick and your stomach and throw up than with regular flu. But a lab test is the only way to know. Even a rapid flu test you can get in your doctor's office won't tell you for sure.To test for swine flu, your doctor runs a swab -- a bigger version of the ones in your bathroom -- up the inside of your nose around the back of your throat. But the test isn’t as common or widespread as those for regular flu. So the only people who really need to be tested are those in the hospital or those at high risk for life-threatening problems from swine flu, such as:Some of the same antiviral drugs that are used to treat seasonal flu also work against H1N1 swine flu. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), and zanamivir (Relenza) seem to work best, although some kinds of swine flu don’t respond to oseltamivir.These drugs can help you get well faster. They can also make you feel better. They work best when you take them within 48 hours of the first flu symptoms, but they can help even if you get them later on.
Antibiotics won't do anything for you. That’s because flu is caused by a virus, not bacteria.Over-the-counter pain remedies and cold and flu medications can help relieve aches, pains, and fever. Don't give aspirin to children under age 18 because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Make sure that over-the-counter cold medications do not have aspirin before giving them to children.The same flu vaccine that protects against seasonal flu also protects against the H1N1 swine flu strain. You can get it as a shot or as a nasal spray. Either way, it "teaches" your immune system to attack the real virus.Besides a flu shot, there are other things you can do to stay healthy:SOURCES:CDC: "Influenza: The Disease," "H1N1 Flu (Swine Flu) and You," "Antiviral Drugs and H1N1 Flu (Swine Flu)," "Interim Guidance for Clinicians on Identifying and Caring for Patients with Swine-origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection."World Health Organization: "Vaccines for the new influenza A (H1N1)."Flu.gov.Pagination15 tips to help you feel better.Do echinacea and vitamin C really help a cold?Get a good night’s rest with these remedies.Eat these to fight colds, flu, and more.© 2005 - 2019 WebMD LLC.

It's named for a virus that pigs can get. People do not normally get swine flu, but human infections can and do happen.  In 2009 a strain of swine flu called H1N1 infected many people around the world.The virus is contagious and can spread from human to human.   Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.There are antiviral medicines you can take to prevent or treat swine flu. There is a vaccine available to protect against swine flu.

Driven to Discover.Dec 2, 2011 (CIDRAP News) – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got a head start on preparing a vaccine against the novel swine-origin influenza strain recently found in four states by using a slightly different swine-origin strain that cropped up last year, CDC officials said today.Since early September, the CDC has reported 10 infections with a swine-origin H3N2 reassortant strain that includes the M gene from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. On Nov 22 the CDC reported that it had prepared a vaccine virus and was providing it to vaccine manufacturers as a precaution in case the novel virus spreads.A flu update from the World Health Organization (WHO) today revealed that the vaccine virus is based on an isolate that was collected in Minnesota in 2010. A CDC official told CIDRAP News that the isolate is from a pair of swine-origin H3N2 infections that occurred in Minnesota in November 2010. Those cases were among five swine-origin H3N2 cases reported in three states during the 2010-11 flu season.The 2010 strain is not an exact match for the recent novel H3N2 isolates, but it is close enough to be the basis for a vaccine, said Michael Shaw, PhD, associate director for laboratory science in the CDC's Influenza Division."Since we were seeing these cases popping up sporadically, over the summer the decision was made to go ahead and try to make a high-yield reassortant [for a vaccine], and it turned out to be a good decision, to have it in reserve," Shaw said.He said it takes several weeks to prepare a flu vaccine virus. In the case of the 2009 pandemic, the task took about 6 weeks, from Apr 15 to the end of May, which was considered fast, he noted.The reason the Minnesota isolate was chosen was that it was the only one available at the time that grew in eggs, Shaw explained. "Vaccine strains need to be egg-derived, because inactivated vaccines are grown in eggs," he said. "This one from November 2010 is not like the new reassortant in that it doesn't have that M gene from the H1N1 strain. But the HA [hemagglutinin] is close enough to be a good vaccine match."Hemagglutinin is the viral surface protein that is recognized and targeted by the human immune system. The protein often mutates, making it necessary to formulate new vaccines.Shaw said the hemagglutinin of the 2010 isolate is very closely related to the version found on the recent swine-origin viruses. "We've characterized it genetically and antigenically, so it would be an acceptable vaccine strain, which is why we decided to distribute it to the manufacturers, so they can get some experience with it and grow it, in case they have to scale up.""All the major manufacturers are looking at it," he said. The CDC provides the virus to any US or foreign manufacturer that wants it.To make a vaccine virus, the CDC first takes clinical isolates and puts them in eggs to see if they will grow, Shaw explained. Once an isolate that grows in eggs is identified, it is recombined with a laboratory strain that grows well in eggs. That task is handled by a separate lab at New York Medical College. The desired product is a "high-yield reassortant": a virus with internal genes from the lab strain and surface genes from the clinical isolate.After a high-yield reassortant is obtained, it must be characterized to make sure it hasn't changed too much in the course of the lab manipulations, Shaw said. "There's a great deal of consultation with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the WHO to reach the conclusion that it is the best one for its purposes," he added. "So about 6 weeks for the pandemic one, that's a very good timeline."Since the creation of the vaccine virus from the 2010 isolate, the CDC has succeeded in growing one of the more recent novel H3N2 viruses, from an Indiana case, in eggs, but "we don't have a high-yield reassortant available for it," Shaw said. "For now the Minnesota one is the only one that's egg-derived and for which we have a high-yield reassortant."Shaw said no more infections with the novel H3N2 strain have been reported since the three that were cited in Iowa children on Nov 22. Those cases were believed to involve person-to-person transmission, since the children attended the same daycare center and none of them had any exposure to pigs.Nine of the 10 recent cases have been in children; all the patients recovered. Besides the Iowa illnesses, the cases include 2 in Indiana, 3 in Pennsylvania, and 2 in Maine.See also: Dec 2 WHO flu update mentioning the vaccine virusWHO details on vaccine virusNov 23 CIDRAP News storyNov 22 CDC statementSep 2 CIDRAP News story about the first of the 10 recent novel H3N2 casesJun 2 CIDRAP News storyJune 3 MMWR article describing five swine-origin H3N2 cases during 2010-11 flu season, including two in MinnesotaGet CIDRAP news and other free newsletters.Sign up now»Unrestricted financial support provided by  Grant support for ASP provided byCIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research and PolicyOffice of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN© 2019 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

More information on updates for the 2018-2019 season are available on CDC’s Current Season What You Need to Know page.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Fluzone Intradermal [296 Kb, 24 pages], a trivalent (three-component) inactivated vaccine for use in people 18 years to 64 years for use during the 2012-2013 season. A quadrivalent (four component) formulation of Fluzone Intradermal was subsequently approved in 2014. All Fluzone Intradermal vaccine is now quadrivalent.This document provides information on the Intradermal Influenza (Flu) Vaccination. Visit Key Facts About Seasonal Flu Vaccine for more information about seasonal flu vaccines.The intradermal flu vaccine is a shot that is injected into the skin instead of the muscle. The intradermal shot uses a much smaller needle than the regular flu shot, and it requires less antigen to be as effective as the regular flu shot. Antigen is the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against flu viruses.The intradermal flu vaccine has a similar safety profile to the regular Fluzone flu shot. Like all quadrivalent flu vaccines, the intradermal vaccine is made to protect against four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common for the season. The intradermal flu vaccine works in the body in the same way as a regular flu shot.The intradermal flu vaccine uses a very fine needle that is 90% smaller than the needles used for regular flu shots. This may be helpful for people who don’t like needles. Another feature of the intradermal vaccine is that it requires 40% less antigen than the regular flu shot. This is useful because the same amount of available antigen can be used to make more doses of the vaccine.Fluzone Intradermal® is approved for use in adults aged 18 through 64 years of age.The intradermal vaccine is supplied in a single-dose, preservative-free (without thimerosal), prefilled syringe. Top of PageYes. In adults 18-64 years of age, the intradermal vaccine has been shown to provide an immune response similar to the regular flu shot that is given in the muscle.The risk of intradermal flu vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Each year millions of people are vaccinated against the flu and serious side effects are extremely rare. However, vaccine, like any medicine, may rarely cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.Intradermal flu vaccine cannot cause the flu because the viruses used to make it are inactivated (killed).In studies, common reactions to the intradermal flu shot included redness, swelling, toughness, pain, and itching at the injection site. With the exception of pain, these side effects were more common with the intradermal shot than they are with regular flu shots. Other side effects included headache, muscle ache, and tiredness. These symptoms usually go away within 3 to 7 days.While severe reactions are uncommon, you should let your doctor, nurse, clinic, or pharmacist know if you have a history of allergy or severe reaction to flu vaccine or any part of flu vaccine, including eggs, or if you have had Guillain-Barré Syndrome.For more information about the intradermal vaccine, see Sanofi Pasteur’s Fluzone Intradermal press release. Top of PageTo receive weekly email updates about Seasonal Flu, enter your email address:Archived Flu Emails%PDF-1.6%âãÏÓ
