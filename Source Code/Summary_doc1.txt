Well, the Spanish flu, which for example killed more american soldiers during WWI than those killed in combat, was the background of "the hype". 0.548376
On the one hand, we have a swine flu pandemic that was hyped out of all proportion by everyone from governments to media and health professionals – a supposedly killer plague that actually killed a fraction of the people of a normal flu season. 0.534006
My local clinic has been trying to find a reason for this but without success.I would like to know is this degeneration could be linked to the H1N1 "safe" swine flu vaccine and if so is there a treatment. 0.469098
This latest data from Ireland and Sweden is highly significant in that it marks the views of two governments, both of which are brazenly prepared to openly inform their populations that they acknowledge significant risks of swine flu vaccination. 0.277844
A new form of swine flu, H1N1, was – our governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) assured us – more deadly than ever, especially to young people, pregnant women and the elderly. 0.265499
It topped the list with 779 suspected adverse reactions, holding off stiff competition from the antidepressant clozapine (543), the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (507) and the childhood vaccination schedule (379). 0.225705
For anyone contemplating flu vaccination, or indeed any vaccination, your decision has ultimately got to be one based on an evaluation of both the risks and the benefits. 0.211260
Despite this, the EMA still recommends Pandemrix in certain situations for its “positive” risk–benefit profile, and describes narcolepsy as a “very rare” side effect of the vaccine. 0.198785
